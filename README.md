## Main problem :new_moon_with_face:
Busy people cannot find a service quickly and easily or service providers market their services.

## Solution :bulb:
Make an app to facilitate users reaching the appropriate services and connect with the affordable and good service provider at the right time.



## User Journey :airplane:
### as a customer:
I can sign up in the app by filling the form that lets me enter full details about me to let the people see my profile and contact me and I can see all available services providers, book a provider and contact them with my needs.
### as a provider:
I can register to specify my service, hourly pricing, and extra information, and see all orders from customers with details, accept or reject them, contact them and receive notification after completing my work.
